Kraph is a graph-database backend service for the Arkitekt Framework.
It allows you to easily connect all data entities in your project and query them using "knowledge" queries.

## Features

- **Graph Database**: Kraph is a graph database that allows you to connect all data entities in your project.

- **Knowledge Queries**: Kraph allows you to query your data using "knowledge" queries. The queries are written in Cypher, a graph query language.

- **Data Integration**: Kraph integrates with all other services in the Arkitekt Framework, such as Mikro and soon Elektro.

- **Multi Graphs** : Kraph allows you to create multiple graphs for different use cases.

- **Ontologies**: Kraph allows you to define ontologies for your data entities. This makes it easier to query your data using knowledge queries.
